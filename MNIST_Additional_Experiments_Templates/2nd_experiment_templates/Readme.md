In all the three templates the following consistent modifications were done and the experiment was run:

Digits 2 and 4 were used as normal instead of 4. The abnormal digit 8 (the same).

The bottleneck dimension was decreased to 16 from 32 (in the case of VAE and modified VAE this is the coding size).

A dense layer of 256 was added to the encoder and decoder.

Batch size decreased to 16 from 512.

The number of epochs was the same (100).
